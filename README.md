Defacto: A default text plugin for humans.
==========================================

jQuery.defacto is a [jQuery][1] plugin that replaces the `value` of a given `<input>` field with the text you type when focused. It allows for default text to be embedded in text/password inputs, and ensures consistent functionality across all browsers. It was designed to be simple, straightforward, and most of all easy to use. 

Features
--------

- Cross-browser compatible, tested in Firefox 3.6+, all versions of Chrome/Safari, and Internet Explorer 5.5+
- Changeable default text color

Roadmap
-------

- Dim default text until typing occurs (a la apple.com)
- Leverage existing HTML5 default text features in modern browsers
